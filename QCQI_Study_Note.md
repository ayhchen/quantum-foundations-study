# Quantum Computation and Quantum Information [Nielson & Chuang] - Study Note

## 1.2 Quantum bits

$|\cdot\rangle$ - Diract notation

Possible states for a qubit:
- Computational basic states:
  - $|0\rangle$
  - $|1\rangle$
- Superpositions:
  - $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$ (*linear combinations* of states), where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$
 
Much more restricted info about the quantum state when measured in QM:
```
When we measure a qubit we get either the result 0, with prob $|\alpha|^2$, or the result 1, with prob $|\beta|$^2. Since the prob's must sum to one, $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
```
